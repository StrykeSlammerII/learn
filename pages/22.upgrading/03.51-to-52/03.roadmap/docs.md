<!-- ### UserFrosting 6

Meanwhile, work for [UserFrosting 6](/upgrading/46-to-50/roadmap#userfrosting-6) is moving along! As a reminder, UF6 goal is to completely rewrite the frontend, with a brand new custom theme replacing AdminLTE and based on [UIKit](https://getuikit.com). Handlebar and every frontend javascript code will also be replaced with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). 

You can find a proof of concept of this new Vue.js based UI (built with UF5) and the foundation of the new theme, **Pink Cupcake**, at the links below.
