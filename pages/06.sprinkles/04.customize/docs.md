This guide assumes that you've already completed the [installation guide](/installation) and successfully managed to get UserFrosting working in your [local development environment](/background/develop-locally-serve-globally) using the [Skeleton](/structure/introduction#the-app-skeleton-your-project-s-template). If not, please do that now - feel free to [ask for help](/troubleshooting/getting-help) if you're running into trouble!

## Custom Namespace and Name

The Skeleton application, used as a base installation for every new installation since UserFrosting 5, is a great way to start your UserFrosting project. It comes with some default values which you can change to make your App yours, starting with the PHP Namespace, info in the `composer.json`, and the sprinkle name in the Sprinkle Recipe.

### composer.json

The most important part to edit here is the Namespace. The namespace tells Composer where to look for source code in a PHP application. By default, the base namespace in the Skeleton is `UserFrosting\App`, but you can change this to whatever you want. The usual scheme is `{Vendor}\{Project}`, where *Vendor* is your brand and *Project* your project name, but there's no *law* you have to follow here.

[notice]Compared to previous version of UserFrosting, **starting from UserFrosting 5**, the namespace isn't strict anymore. There's no more convention to follow.[/notice]

The namespace is defined in the `composer.json` file in the base directory of your sprinkle. The default file looks like this : 

Original **composer.json**
```json

        }
    },
    "scripts": {
        "post-create-project-cmd" : "php bakery bake"
    }
}
```

Let's change thing up. All the metadata can be customized to reflect your project, and we'll define the new namespace to `Owlfancy\Site` : 

Modified **composer.json**
```json
{
    "name": "owlfancy/site",
    "type": "userfrosting-sprinkle",
    "description": "Site sprinkle for owlfancy.com.",
    "license" : "MIT",
    "authors" : [
        {
            "name": "David Attenborough",
            "homepage": "https://attenboroughsreef.com"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.0",
        "ext-gd": "*",
        "userfrosting/framework": "^5.0",
        "userfrosting/sprinkle-core": "^5.0",
        "userfrosting/sprinkle-account": "^5.0",
        "userfrosting/sprinkle-admin": "^5.0",
        "userfrosting/theme-adminlte": "^5.0"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer": "^3.0",
        "phpstan/phpstan": "^1.1",
        "phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules": "^1.0",
        "phpstan/phpstan-mockery": "^1.0",
        "phpstan/phpstan-phpunit": "^1.0",
        "phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules": "^1.0",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "^9.5",
        "mockery/mockery": "^1.2",
        "league/factory-muffin": "^3.0",
        "league/factory-muffin-faker": "^2.0"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Owlfancy\\Site\\": "app/src"
        }
    },
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Owlfancy\\Site\\Tests\\": "app/tests/"
        }
    }
}
```

The important part here is the `autoload.psr-4` key. This tells Composer to map the root `src/` directory of your sprinkle to the root **namespace** `Owlfancy\Site\`.

[notice]If you're not familiar with PSR-4, it is a standard that says we should map a base directory to a base namespace, and then the relative namespaces of classes in that directory should correspond to the relative paths of their class files. For example, the directory `/app/src/Controller/OwlController.php` would be mapped to the fully qualified class name `\Owlfancy\Site\Controller\OwlController`.[/notice]

The next step is to run Composer from your project directory, so that it can detect the changes in `composer.json` and update the appropriate mappings. You only need to run this once, when you make any changes to the `composer.json` file  - any new classes that you add to `src/` will be automatically picked up in the future.

```bash
$ composer update
```

[notice=note]If after running these steps, UserFrosting fails to find new classes that you add to `src/`, make sure that that the user running Composer had read permissions for your sprinkle. You can check that the path to your sprinkle's `src/` directory was actually added in `app/vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` You can also try running Composer with the `-vvv` flag for more detailed reporting.[/notice]

### The recipe

The next step is to update every reference of `UserFrosting\App` to `Owlfancy\Site`, in each PHP files inside `app/src/`. But there's one file that might require a bit more attention. The recipe, located in `app/src/MyApp.php` can be renamed to reflect your project. For example, we can rename it to `app/src/Owlfancy.php`. The class name should also be renamed to `Owlfancy`. We'll also edit the `getName()` method, to reflect our project name : 

```php
<?php

namespace Owlfancy\Site;

use Owlfancy\Site\Bakery\HelloCommand;
use UserFrosting\Sprinkle\Account\Account;
use UserFrosting\Sprinkle\Admin\Admin;
use UserFrosting\Sprinkle\BakeryRecipe;
use UserFrosting\Sprinkle\Core\Core;
use UserFrosting\Sprinkle\SprinkleRecipe;
use UserFrosting\Theme\AdminLTE\AdminLTE;

class Owlfancy implements
    SprinkleRecipe,
    BakeryRecipe
{
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'Owlfancy';
    }

    // ...
}
```

### The entry files

There's still one last thing to edit. Since we changed the recipe from `UserFrosting\App\MyApp` to `Owlfancy\Site\Owlfancy`, we also need to update that in the entry files, which are `public/index.php` and `bakery`:

**/public/index.php**
```php
<?php

// First off, we'll grab the Composer dependencies
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

// Workaround to get php built-in server to access legacy assets
// @see : https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/359#issuecomment-363076423
if (PHP_SAPI == 'cli-server') {
    $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] = '/index.php';
}

use Owlfancy\Site\Owlfancy; // <-- Here
use UserFrosting\UserFrosting;

$uf = new UserFrosting(Owlfancy::class); // <-- Here
$uf->run();
```

**/bakery**
```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

/**
 * Require composer autoload file. Not having this file means Composer might not be installed / run
 */
if (!file_exists(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php')) {
    die("ERROR :: File `".__DIR__."/vendor/autoload.php` not found. This indicate that composer has not yet been run on this install. Install composer and run `composer install` from the project root directory. Check the documentation for more details.\n");
} else {
    require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
}

use Owlfancy\Site\Owlfancy; // <-- Here
use UserFrosting\Bakery\Bakery;

/**
 * Get and run CLI App
 */
$bakery = new Bakery(Owlfancy::class); // <-- Here
$bakery->run();
```

## Configuration settings

Next, let's try setting some basic configuration settings. To do this, simply create a new subdirectory in your sprinkle, `config`, and inside that create a file `default.php`:

```txt
app
└── config
    └── default.php
```

In `default.php`, add the following:

```php
<?php

    /**
     * Sample site configuration file for UserFrosting. You should definitely set these values!
     *
     */
    return [
        'address_book' => [
            'admin' => [
                'name'  => 'Squawkbot'
            ]
        ],
        'debug' => [
            'smtp' => true
        ],
        'site' => [
            'author'    =>      'David Attenborough',
            'title'     =>      'Owl Fancy',
            // URLs
            'uri' => [
                'author' => 'https://attenboroughsreef.com'
            ]
        ],
        'php' => [
            'timezone' => 'Europe/London'
        ]
    ];
```

This customizes some basic properties for our application - you can set your site title, author, author's URL, and timezone. Reload the page, and you should see the new site title appear in the upper left corner:

![Overriding site settings in config file](/images/site-title.png)

The template for this page dynamically pulls that particular piece of text from your new configuration file. Note that your value for `site.title` overrides the value of `site.title` in the core sprinkle's configuration file.

[notice=tip]You can [override configuration values](/configuration/config-files) from any previously loaded sprinkles, including the default sprinkles that ship with UserFrosting. Check the Core sprinkle and the Account sprinkle `/app/config/default.php` for a complete list.[/notice]
