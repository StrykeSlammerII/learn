<!-- ### redirect.onAlreadyLoggedIn

Returns a callback that redirects the client when they attempt to perform certain guest actions, but they are already logged in. For example, if they attempt to visit the registration or login pages when they are already signed in, this service will be used to redirect them to an appropriate landing page. -->

<!-- ### redirect.onLogin

Returns a callback that sets the `UF-Redirect` header in the response. This callback is automatically invoked in the `AccountController::login` method. The `UF-Redirect` header is used by client-side code to determine where to redirect a given user after they log in.

See [_Changing the post-login destination_](/recipes/custom-login-page#changing-the-post-login-destination) for an example on how to customixzed this in your own sprinkle. -->
