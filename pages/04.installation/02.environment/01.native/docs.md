The **native installation** guide will first show you the steps to install all the tools and app required to run your own local development environment. Once this is done, the second part contains the steps required to get UserFrosting itself up and running. 

If you already have a local environment and you're familiar with tools like **composer**, the first part also contains step to make sure you have the *appropriate version* of everything setup. If you're already up to date, you can skip to the second part right away. 

If you're don't want to install the required software natively, you may instead want to consider setting up [Docker](/installation/environment/docker) as a pre-configured virtual environment.
